This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) personal project to practice and learn new web development technologies.

## About bycherrie blog
This is a blog to display my newest crochet projects built with Next.js, Sanity.io, and Tailwind.css.

It's main feature is to use dynamic routing to automatically create new blog pages whenever the CMS is updated with a blog post.
I hope you enjoy.
